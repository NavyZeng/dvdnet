# DVDnet
A State-of-the-art, simple and fast network for Deep Video Denoising

## Video examples
 You can download several denoised sequences with our algorithm and other methods [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gccey7wuxiqr104/AAC_v6kb3fMYxMHBc6wcqu17a?dl=0 "DVDnet denoised sequences")
 
 ## Comparison of PSNRs
Two different testsets were used for benchmarking our method: the DAVIS-test testset, and Set8, which is composed of 4 color sequences from the [Derfâ€™s Test Media collection](https://media.xiph.org/video/derf) and 4 color sequences captured with a GoPro camera. The DAVIS set contains 30 color sequences of resolution 854 x 480. The sequences of Set8 have been downscaled to a resolution of 960 x 540. In all cases, sequences were limited to a maximum of 85 frames. We used the DeepFlow algorithm to compute flow maps for DVDnet and VNLB.
